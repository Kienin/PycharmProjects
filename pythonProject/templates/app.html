        <h2>About Computer Science</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Science is the study of computers and computing technologies. It involves understanding algorithms, data structures, programming languages,
            software development, artificial intelligence, and much more. Computer scientists design and create software, develop new technologies, and solve complex problems.

        <h2>Python Programming Language</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, including web development,
            data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more. Python's syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to
            languages like C++ or Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python has a large and active community, a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

        <h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>
        <p>
            To get started with Python, you need to install the Python interpreter on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python Downloads</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once installed, you can start writing Python code using a simple text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!":
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
        </pre>
